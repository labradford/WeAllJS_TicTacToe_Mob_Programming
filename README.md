# WeAllJS_TicTacToe_Mob_Programming

These are the starter files for the We All JS Meetup group - Let's build a JS project mob programming style.
HTML CSS and JS templates are all created. 
Complete the user stories one at a time. Only work on one story, do not try to move ahead and do more than one item at a time.
Have lots of fun!
